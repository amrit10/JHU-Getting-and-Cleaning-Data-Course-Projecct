## Goal of the Project

1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repo with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called 
CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md file in the repo with 
your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how 
they are connected.
4. run_analysis.R script

## Scope

The script run_analysis.R downloads the dataset (UCI Human Activity 
Recognition Using Smartphone Dataset), cleans the data by performing 
certain transformations (mentioned in CodeBook.md) and writes the tidy 
data set to the present working directory.

## Instructions

1. Clone/Download the repo.
2. Run run_analysis.R file in RStudio or R on your machine.

* To save the tidy data set in a directory of your choice, change the 
present working directory in RStudio/R.
